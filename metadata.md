# Metadata

This section covers the details of the different formats and guidelines for a typical metadata spreadsheet created in the CDIL. Every scanned collection will eventually have its own specific metadata. 

Metadata describes and gives information about other data. The metadata we create for our digital collections records everything we know about the item. 

In the CDIL we use the [Dublin Core Metadata Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core). These guidelines provide a standard for how we format and make our metadata readable for a large audience. 

Not all of the fields listed below will appear on every metadata spreadsheet. Some spreadsheets will have extra or fewer fields depending on the subject material. Each field serves a purpose for both preservation and access of an item. 

The metadata categories in this document are divided into two different guides: one for CDIL student workers and one for CDIL staff. **If you are a student worker**, please only fill in the metadata categories in the student worker section.

Refer to CDIL staff if you have questions about metadata not answered in the document.

This is a scanning guide for anyone conducting digitization work in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) Lab.

Before you scan:
- Ensure that hands are clean and dry before handling materials.
- Wear cotton gloves when necessary (ask CDIL staff if unsure).
- Handle items with extreme care.
- Give your full attention to the scanning process.

## Why do we scan?

Scanning materials with a flatbed, large format, or feed scanner is often the safest and most efective means to preserve an item's information. Creating digital copies of items also allows us to make them available to patrons using the internet. 

Scanning items at a high resolution allows us to use them in different ways without manipulating the items themselves. For this reason, we aim for a minimum 600 dpi image when scanning. This size specification provides a scalable file that can be used for large or small reprints while maintaining the original details of the item. 

#### File Naming

Every scanned item needs a file name. A standardized file naming system helps us know exactly where an item belongs. Scanned files should be named using the following standardized naming rules:
  
  **collectionabbreviation_box#_envelope/folder#-item#subitem**
  
  Notes:
  1. Collection abbreviation refers to an abbreviated version of either Manuscript Group (mg) or Photograph Group (pg).
  2. All information needed to name items should be found on the item and the folder, envelope, or box that it comes in.
  3. When in doubt about how to name an item, talk to CDIL staff.

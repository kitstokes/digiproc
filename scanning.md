# Scanning

This is a scanning guide for anyone conducting digitization work in the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) Lab.

Before you scan:
- Ensure that hands are clean and dry before handling materials.
- Wear cotton gloves when necessary (ask CDIL staff if unsure).
- Handle items with extreme care.
- Give your full attention to the scanning process.

## Why do we scan?

Scanning materials with a flatbed, large format, or feed scanner is often the safest and most efective means to preserve an item's information. Creating digital copies of items also allows us to make them available to patrons using the internet. 

Scanning items at a high resolution allows us to use them in different ways without manipulating the items themselves. For this reason, we aim for a minimum 600 dpi image when scanning. This size specification provides a scalable file that can be used for large or small reprints while maintaining the original details of the item.

## File Naming

Every scanned item needs a file name. A standardized file naming system helps us know exactly where an item belongs. Scanned files should be named using the following standardized naming rules:
  
  **collectionabbreviation_box#_envelope/folder#-item#subitem**
  
    Notes:
     1. Collection abbreviation refers to an abbreviated version of either Manuscript Group (mg) or Photograph Group (pg).
     2. All information needed to name items should be found on the item and the folder, envelope, or box that it comes in.
     3. When in doubt about how to name an item, talk to CDIL staff. 

  **File name examples:**
  
  Manuscript Group 190, box 4, folder 2, letter 1, with multiple pages becomes:
  - mg190_b4_f2-001p001
  - mg190_b4_f2-001p002
  - etc.

  Photograph Group 3, box 1, photograph 3 becomes:
  - pg3_b1-003

## Scanning Images

#### Prepare to scan:

1. Go to your personal folder in the **Scans** folder on the C: drive at your workstation.
2. If CDIL staff has not done so already, create a folder for the scanning project titled after the collection you're scanning (e.g. MG 190).
3. Inside that folder, create another folder called **tiff**. This will be the destination for your initial scans.

#### How to scan an image

1. Turn on scanner at station. 
2. Open EpsonScan scanning software from the shortcut on the desktop.
3. Place the item along the left side of the scanning bed (the glass plate). Leave a slight border between the item and the edge of the glass. 
4. Position the color separation guide so that the more saturated bar is beside the item you're scanning. Leave a 1/8" gap between the guide and the item.
5. Close the scanner lid and press **Preview** in EpsonScan.
6. After the scan finished, use the cursor to draw the selection window around the edge of the item. Include as much of the color separation guide as is needed to color balance the item. See image below:
*
7. In EpsonScan, set **Resolution** to 600 dpi and set the length of the longest edge of the item to at least 6,000 pixels. Refer to the image below. If other settings on your screen do not match what's in this image, ask CDIL staff before scanning:
*
8. After your settings are correct, press **Scan**.
9. In the **File Save Settings** window, you need to:
  - Click **Other** and then **Browse** to select the folder you want your images to save to. This should be the folder labeled tif in the folder for the scanning project.
  - Enter the file name prefix. This should be the file name you created minus the **subitem** number, which the Start Number field will fill in.
  - In the Image Format section, set file type to **TIFF (*.tif)**.
  Refer to the image below:
  *
10. Press OK and the scan will begin.

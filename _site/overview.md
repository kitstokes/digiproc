# Overview

The University of Idaho Library houses thousands of primary research sources; most of them are held in Special Collections and Archives. Digital Initiatives and the Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) lab are at the forefront of making these sources accessible and usable. Our digitization efforts allow patrons around the world to access these materials while keeping originals intact, preserved, and available for local use.

The materials we digitize in the CDIL are not allowed to leave the library due to their value, their condition, or a combination of these two factors. Materials like old photographs, first-edition copies of books, and other one-of-a-kind items are irreplaceable if damaged or lost. So, Digital Initiatives and the CDIL are dedicated to providing access to these materials through digital means. The images we create, the information we publish, and the resources we design are all compiled with the intent of making Special Collections and Archives materials more broadly accessible.

Given the inherent intellectual and historical value of the materials we work with in the lab, the CDIL is committed to digitization processes that uphold the integrity of these materials. Every item that comes through the lab is digitized with utmost care and attention to detail so that patrons, researchers, and curious viewers alike may access these collections.

In this guide you will find instructions for every step of the digitization process used in the CDIL, including:
- Scanning
- Processing

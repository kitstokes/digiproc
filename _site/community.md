## Equipment Recommendations

### Scanners

The type of scanner you need depends on the types of items you plan to scan. The CDIL recommends using a flatbed scanner to scan your items as any type of feed scanner has potential to damage delicate photos and documents.

Look for a scanner with a bed size that will fit the largest of the items you'll be scanning. 8 1/2" x 11" will typically work unless you have many oversized items. If you'll be scanning slides and film, opt for a scanner with a built-in transparency unit. For high-quality scans, you'll need a scanner capable of at least 600 dpi. 

### External Hard Drive

Consider purchasing an external hard drive to store your scans if you'll be creating many high resolution TIFF files. This will prevent your computer storage from filling up. It will also protect your files and make them easily transportable. 

Opt for an external hard drive with 1 terabyte or greater of storage if possible. This should provide plenty of space for all of your scanning projects. 

## Scanning Specifications

In the CDIL we have very specific technical requirements to create archival quality scans. Your process may differ depending on your needs:

- **DPI**: DPI, or dots per inch, measures the resolution of a digital scan. We scan images at 600 dpi and documents at 400 dpi.
- **Pixels**: we scan all items at 6,000 pixels on the longest edge of the item. 
- **File type: we scan all images to .tiff format and all documents to .jpeg. Visit the [Adobe website](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/file-types/image/comparison/jpeg-vs-tiff.html) for more information about TIFF vs JPEG files. 

## Processing Your Images

After digitizing your images or documents, there are a few different things you can do to process and build your collection:

- **Photoshop**: the CDIL uses Adobe Photoshop to process the digital files from our scanning projects. Visit the [Processing]() page for a guide to these procedures. 
- **GIMP**: if you don't have access to Photoshop, [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) is a free image editing software with similar functions.
- **Metadata**: you may want to create some metadata to describe your images. Visit the [Metadata]() page to see some common metadata fields the CDIL uses when describing collections. We recommmend using [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/) to create your metadata.
